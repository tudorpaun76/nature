<p class="textone">Maple, (Acer), any of a large genus (about 200 species) of shrubs or trees in the family Sapindaceae, widely distributed in the North Temperate Zone but concentrated in China. Maples constitute one of the most important groups of ornamentals for planting in lawns, along streets, and in parks. They offer a great variety of form, size, and foliage; many display striking autumn colour. Several yield maple syrup, and some provide valuable, dense hard wood for furniture and other uses. All maples bear pairs of winged seeds, called samaras or keys. The leaves are arranged oppositely on twigs. Many maples have lobed leaves, but a few have leaves separated into leaflets.</p>

 <p class="pines">Pines are some of the best-known plants around the world. They possess huge economic importance through the timber trade and are easily identifiable due to their characteristic cone-shaped growth form and needle-like leaves.The pines are a family of around 250 woody, seed-producing plants. They include conifers such as cedars, spruces, firs and pines. Of all the conifers, the pines have one of the largest distributions although they are found almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
 
 <p class="oak">Oak belongs to the genus Quercus which comprises over 600 different species of trees. Most species of oak trees are deciduous with only couple of evergreen forms. Oak trees live on the Northern hemisphere. They can survive in various forests, including those in temperate climates, Mediterranean and tropical areas. Oak trees are prone to fungal diseases that may induce rotting of the inner part of the plant. Besides fungi, insects often attack oaks and induce defoliation (removal of the leaves). 78 species of oaks are listed as endangered because of the habitat destruction, over exploitation, diseases and introduction of invasive species<p>
